# Mergesort In All Languages

This is a project that is here to demonstrate different implementations of the [merge sort algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort).<br>
Pick up a [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages) and try to implement it yourself

  
## Running all of the versions
 
 Install everything you need and run: `./run.sh`

## Pull Requests

 Make sure you have your language running in CI and it uses the list [5,9,1,3,4,6,6,3,2]

 We will also merge PRs that clean up existing languages to be easier to read or more canonical to the language
