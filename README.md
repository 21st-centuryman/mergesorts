# Mergesort In All Languages

Are you tired of unsorted arrays? Do you wanna smash your keyboard when you see the array:
:facepunch::facepunch::facepunch:[5,9,1,3,4,6,6,3,2]:facepunch::facepunch::facepunch:<br>

Well look no further! We provide the number one leading industry proven AI :fireworks: (kinda) decentralized :pager: language agnostic mergesorts.<br>
:raising_hand:Why mergesort?? Idiotic question. Thank me later for vastly improving your life.

Don't know [merge sort algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort).<br>

Pick up a [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages) and try to implement it yourself

  
## Running all of the versions
 
 Install everything you need and run: `./run.sh`

## Pull Requests

 Make sure you have your language running in CI and it uses the list [5,9,1,3,4,6,6,3,2]

 We will also merge PRs that clean up existing languages to be easier to read or more canonical to the language
